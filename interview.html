    <div class="interview-content">
        <div class="question">Q: "What is the most important direction or philosophy when working on design?"</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: I believe that good design and perfect design are different. Good design is already excellent, but perfect design carries the power to move others, which I think is unattainable by just good design.<br><br>
            In a simplified way, as Millet's 'The Gleaners' suggests, "How can anyone be moved by something I haven't been moved by?" That's what I believe perfect design is.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q: "How would you describe your design style in one word?"</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: Creating high-quality, sensitive spirits.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q: "What is the most important element when designing fashion?"</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: ‘Less is more.’ I believe that adding more ingredients doesn’t make it tastier; it just increases the quantity. Also, I value the perspective and knowledge to integrate techniques from other fields of study.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q: “Is there a place or person that inspires your fashion design work?”</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: I refer to it as ‘MMM,’ and I believe those who know, know.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q: “What message or theme do you want to convey through fashion design?”</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: This is something I always emphasize myself: “If you like it, buy it without considering the price, no matter how cheap it is.”
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q: “What is your goal or dream for the future?”</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: I just want to break down and reassemble the archives of various brands. I see my biggest strength as ‘reinterpretation.’
